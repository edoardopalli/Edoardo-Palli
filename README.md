## Hi there!
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer. I'm working at Lokky, an insurance company based in Milan. 
I have a Master of Sciensce in Mathematical Engineering - Statistical Learning, from Politecnico di Milano. 

I am passionate about Statistics and Machine Learning. I love sports, in particular football, and I would love to work in that field
applying my statistical knowledges.
I am familiar with Python, R, C++, and Matlab.

Here is some of the research I enjoy doing:

- ML Optimization
- Reinforcement Learning methods
- Functional Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Nonparametric Statistics
- Bayesian Statistics
